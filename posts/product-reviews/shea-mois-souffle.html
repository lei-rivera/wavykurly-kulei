        <h1>Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curling Gel Souffle</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            On my search for a gel that contained coconut oil, the main two products I kept coming across were both from
            Shea Moisture's Coconut and Hibiscus line. One being the Styling Gel (you can look at the review
            <a href="shea-mois-gel.html">here</a>), and the other being the curling gel souffle.
        </p>

        <p>
            I saw a lot more results about the gel souffle than the styling gel, likely because the styling gel was
            newer. I wanted to try the styling gel first as it was marketed a gel rather than a 'souffle' or 'custard'
            (which I find tend to be one and done stylers with less hold).
        </p>

        <p>
            However, after my experience with the styling gel was a fail, I sought out the souffle from the same line,
            hoping it would give me better results. Throughout this review you'll see me constantly comparing this
            souffle to the styling gel from the same line. It is because my expectations of this product rely on my hope
            that it will turn out better than my experience with the styling gel.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the context of this review, my hair is a 2c/3a mix, low porosity, medium thickness, and low density. I
            will be approaching the review of this product with a perspective towards hair types similar to me, which
            are on the wavier, finer side. If this product does not work out for me, I suggest what hair types I think
            it could work for, however because I do not have experience with hair types other than my own, my suggestion
            is more so a guess.
        </p>

        <p>
            When looking for products for my own hair I relied a lot on other's peoples reviews, so I hope this review
            helps anyone deciding whether or not to buy this product, as I know it can be tiring constantly buying and
            trying an endless list of products just to see what works out for you.
