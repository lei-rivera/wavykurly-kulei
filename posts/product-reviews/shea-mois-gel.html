            Shea Moisture Coconut And Hibiscus (+Flaxseed) Styling Gel - Review
        </h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Upon discovering my hair really likes coconut oil (I found a coconut oil mousse that has now become my new
            holy grail), I wanted to try finding a coconut oil gel. The dominant product I found in search results was
            the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus + Flaxseed Styling Gel. I had an Ulta coupon so I got it along with
            the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Maximum Hold Gel (for another review)
        </p>

        <p>
            I use reddit a lot when looking at curly hair stuff, and I rarely saw any in depth reviews about this
            product, more so the curling gel souffle (also for another review and is currently in my hair as I write
            this). I wanted to write a somewhat in depth review of this product to help anyone else looking at it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reviews I saw were mixed, with some loving it and some hating it. So I decided to try it for myself. No
            photos this time because I'm dum dum and didn't take any, and I do not plan on recreating the results.
        </p>

        <h2>First Impressions</h2>

        <h3>Price</h3>
        <p>
            In my area, you get a 15oz container for around $10. It's not a terrible price for a gel, but considering
            how it turns out, the price isn't worth it.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>
            I live in an area with above average humidity, so I try to look for products that don't have glycerin in the
            first five ingredients (glycerin will pull moisture from the humid air and bring it into my hair, causing
            frizz). Unfortunately this product as it as its fifth ingredient. I was still willing to try it and see how
            it would hold.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another thing about the ingredients is that it had coconut oil as the 7th ingredient. Which isn't too bad
            for a gel. You need other ingredients to actually give a gel hold. It also has other protein products, such
            as neem oil and silk protein, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with protein sensitive hair
        </p>

        <h3>Smell</h3>

        <p>
            Really nice. Has a light flowery fragrance, which is probably the hibiscus. I don't smell any coconut, which
            could be a pro or con depending on you.
        </p>

        <h3>Consistency</h3>

        <p>
            Thick. I'd say it's thicker than usual gels, like eco or wetline. My hair is medium with a lower density,
            and gets weighed down easily, so I'm not having too high hopes for this.
        </p>

        <h3>Initial Hold</h3>

        <p>
            When I get a new gel, I like to test out its hold before washday by seeing how well it lays my edges. This
            one had no hold. In fact when I checked back on it after it had dried, my baby hairs were floating with
            little flakes. My expectations so far for the product are low.
        </p>

        <h2>Actual Application</h2>

        <p>
            Due to my hair being weighed down easily, I use mousse as a main styler. However mousses don't give good
            enough hold to last me several days, and hairspray drys out my hair (I now how to fix the moisture in my
            hair due to drying it out from improper hairspray use). Hence why I need to use gel.
        </p>

        <h3>Paired With a Foam</h3>

        <p>
            My first test of this product was as a topper to a mousse. I used the Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut
            Milk Curl Foam Mousse, brush styled, then laid the styling gel on top.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hair fell flat within an hour. Unfortunately the Maui Moisture foam had no hold (but great moisture haha
            and definition), and apparently neither did the styling gel.
        </p>

        <p>
            I immediately planned to return the gel, then I thought about giving it another shot by itself instead of
            with a mousse/foam.
        </p>

        <h3>One and Done Styler?</h3>
        <p>
            After shampooing twice and then conditioning, I raked this thoroughly through my hair (man is it thick),
            scrunched, microplopped (plopping would take too much of the product out), and then I like to blast my hair
            with the diffuser on high heat and high speed (don't forget your heat protectant). After that I'll clip my
            roots for volume and let it air dry the rest of the way. Here are my notes during the application process:
        </p>

        <h4>Definition</h4>

        <p>
            The curl clump definition was insane. I don't think I remember my hair clumping this well. Usually when I do
            my routine the curl clumps separate more after microplopping and hover diffusing, however they stayed
            together well. Part of me theorizes its because of the coconut oil (which my curls/waves love) but because
            it's only 7th on the ingredient list, the other part of me is skeptical that the coconut oil is doing
            anything. Whatever it is, one of the best wash day definitions I've had. Initially.
        </p>

        <h4>Hold</h4>

        <p>
            the air drying process is where I notice the hold of a product. My hair develops a cast best when air dried,
            and how hard the cast is tells me how good of a hold the product has. And just like how my hair fell when I
            initially used this with mousse, I only got a slightly better result this time by itself. Once it dried,
            there was barely a cast. Normally I scrunch out the crunch but the cast was so nonexistent you could breathe
            in my hair's general direction and it'd frizz up.
        </p>

        <h4>Flaking</h4>

        <p>
            now when I used this initially on my edges I got flakes, but when I used it for a curly routine, I
            experienced no flaking. Considering that this product barely has any hold, and made no cast, It's not
            surprising. I've noticed that the gels with stronger hold tend to be the ones that flake on me.
        </p>

        <h3>Thoughts?</h3>

        <p>
            When used as a one and done styler, the styling gel gave me beautiful curl clumps, however it gave me no
            long lasting hold. Usually I like to use gels as a topper to my main styler, however this failed as a topper
            for a lightweight foam. If your hair clumps beautifully with coconut oil (as mine does) and you are not
            worried about the weight of your products weighing down your hair, I would use this with a strong hold gel
            on top.
        </p>

        <p>
            I like to test gels as toppers to either a mousse, foam, or leave in. Since this product barely held by
            itself and with no hold to a lightweight foam, I didn't bother testing this with a leave in conditioner. I
            also like to use gels to hold down my hair for a slickback ponytail, bun, or updo, however because this gel
            has no hold I didn't bother trying with a slickback style.
        </p>

        <h2>Day Two and Refreshes</h2>

        <p>
            After sleeping with a silk bonnet on, my hair was already frizzy, despite the product's frizz control
            claims. Hair doesn't feel sticky upon first touch, however after moving my hair back into place (I become
            somewhat of stereotypical asian with a bowl haircut after sleeping with a bonnet), I noticed a tiny bit of
            film on my hands. The film was worse if I rewetted my hair to refresh it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Speaking of refreshing, refreshing with this product is interesting. I normally use a curl cream to spring
            my curls back to life without weighing it down, unlike refreshing with gel, mousse, or foam (which all weigh
            it down or turn it crunchy when I don't want it to).
        </p>

        <p>
            For my refresh, I rewet my hair and applied some of the gel in my hands, emulsified it with water, then
            applied it through my hair and scrunched. Result wasn't bad, and it'd look even better if I diffused. I did
            not due to my sister sleeping while I was getting ready for work.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think if I had a better wash day, refreshing with this product wouldn't be bad.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            Product claims long lasting hold and frizz control, however I barely got any hold in the first day, and it
            was completely messed up the next day. However, it clumped my curls and enhanced my waves really well.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think I'd use this more as a refresh styler, since it has a little more hold than a cream. But since
            there's cheaper and better ways to refresh hair, back to the store it goes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think it'd suit curlies with courser hair who want a lighter hold, but I'm not totally sure.
        </p>

        <p>
            If this was marketed as some kind of curl cream instead of a styling gel, I'd have different expectations
            for it. But since it's marketed as a gel, I'm going to judge its capabilities as a gel.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Overall Score:</strong> 2/10
