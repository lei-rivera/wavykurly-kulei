        <p>
            When I was young, I had short, extremely curly hair. It was enough of a defining factor in my looks for my
            family to give me the nickname "Kuleilei" or "Kulei", with 'Kulei' being a combination of my name and the
            tagalog word 'kulot', which means 'curly'.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite my family genetically having curly hair, no one knew how to take care of curly hair, especially my
            mother. She grew up chemically straightening hers (likely a result of the beauty standards in the
            Philippines), so that's how she cared for her daughters' hair.

        <p>
            Like my sisters, I grew up treating my hair as 'straight'. But I would get frustrated when my 'straight'
            hair would become hard to manage; it would get poofy if I blow dried it, it'd frizz up easily, and layers
            made first-grade me look like Dora the Explorer. At some point I woke up with such rough hair my grandmother
            jokingly called me "bruha", which in Tagalog means "witch" (and was borrowed from the spanish "bruja", like
            many other tagalog words).

            One night, April 2023, I went to bed with wet hair after showering, and woke up in the morning with waves in
            my hair.
            Both my sister and my mother complimented my hair, wondering what I'd done with it when I had literally just
            woken up like that. After that, my sister mentioned how I had curly hair when I was younger and suggested I
            try styling my hair curly.

            It's been almost 2 years since I've started wearing my hair in its natural curly/wavy state and I've been
            loving it. Of course, no journey is without its ups and downs. I am still on the journey myself, and wanted
            to log said ups and downs as well as any little discoveries and helpful tips in this little side blog.

            I am, at heart, a programmer, so to practice my skills as well as indulge in my hair hobby, I decided to
            make this little side blog. It's going to look ugly in the beginning, but I feel like that perfectly
            reflects my hair journey (lol).
